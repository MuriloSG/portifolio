      <p>
        My name is Murilo Santos. In 2019, I had my first contact with
        programming in the course in which I graduated, Technical in Computer
        Science. Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Information Systems, where
        I have had numerous experiences with various technologies and areas that
        I can work in. However, I have been delving into technologies for
        Back-End development.
